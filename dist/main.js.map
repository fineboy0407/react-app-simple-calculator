A rule can be specified as an object, string, or function:\n   *\n   *     const rules = [\n   *       { l: 'n1*n3 + n2*n3', r: '(n1+n2)*n3' },\n   *       'n1*n3 + n2*n3 -> (n1+n2)*n3',\n   *       function (node) {\n   *         // ... return a new node or return the node unchanged\n   *         return node\n   *       }\n   *     ]\n   *\n   * String and object rules consist of a left and right pattern. The left is\n   * used to match against the expression and the right determines what matches\n   * are replaced with. The main difference between a pattern and a normal\n   * expression is that variables starting with the following characters are\n   * interpreted as wildcards:\n   *\n   * - 'n' - matches any Node\n   * - 'c' - matches any ConstantNode\n   * - 'v' - matches any Node that is not a ConstantNode\n   *\n   * The default list of rules is exposed on the function as `simplify.rules`\n   * and can be used as a basis to built a set of custom rules.\n   *\n   * For more details on the theory, see:\n   *\n   * - [Strategies for simplifying math expressions (Stackoverflow)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7540227/strategies-for-simplifying-math-expressions)\n   * - [Symbolic computation - Simplification (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_computation#Simplification)\n   *\n   *  An optional `options` argument can be passed as last argument of `simplify`.\n   *  There is currently one option available:\n   *  - `exactFractions`: a boolean which is `true` by default.\n   *  - `fractionsLimit`: when `exactFractions` is true, a fraction will be returned\n   *    only when both numerator and denominator are smaller than `fractionsLimit`.\n   *    Default value is 10000.\n   *\n   * Syntax:\n   *\n   *     simplify(expr)\n   *     simplify(expr, rules)\n   *     simplify(expr, rules)\n   *     simplify(expr, rules, scope)\n   *     simplify(expr, rules, scope, options)\n   *     simplify(expr, scope)\n   *     simplify(expr, scope, options)\n   *\n   * Examples:\n   *\n   *     math.simplify('2 * 1 * x ^ (2 - 1)')      // Node \"2 * x\"\n   *     math.simplify('2 * 3 * x', {x: 4})        // Node \"24\"\n   *     const f = math.parse('2 * 1 * x ^ (2 - 1)')\n   *     math.simplify(f)                          // Node \"2 * x\"\n   *     math.simplify('0.4 * x', {}, {exactFractions: true})  // Node \"x * 2 / 5\"\n   *     math.simplify('0.4 * x', {}, {exactFractions: false}) // Node \"0.4 * x\"\n   *\n   * See also:\n   *\n   *     derivative, parse, evaluate, rationalize\n   *\n   * @param {Node | string} expr\n   *            The expression to be simplified\n   * @param {Array<{l:string, r: string} | string | function>} [rules]\n   *            Optional list with custom rules\n   * @return {Node} Returns the simplified form of `expr`\n   */\n\n  var simplify = typed('simplify', {\n    string: function string(expr) {\n      return this(parse(expr), this.rules, {}, {});\n    },\n    'string, Object': function stringObject(expr, scope) {\n      return this(parse(expr), this.rules, scope, {});\n    },\n    'string, Object, Object': function stringObjectObject(expr, scope, options) {\n      return this(parse(expr), this.rules, scope, options);\n    },\n    'string, Array': function stringArray(expr, rules) {\n      return this(parse(expr), rules, {}, {});\n    },\n    'string, Array, Object': function stringArrayObject(expr, rules, scope) {\n      return this(parse(expr), rules, scope, {});\n    },\n    'string, Array, Object, Object': function stringArrayObjectObject(expr, rules, scope, options) {\n      return this(parse(expr), rules, scope, options);\n    },\n    'Node, Object': function NodeObject(expr, scope) {\n      return this(expr, this.rules, scope, {});\n    },\n    'Node, Object, Object': function NodeObjectObject(expr, scope, options) {\n      return this(expr, this.rules, scope, options);\n    },\n    Node: function Node(expr) {\n      return this(expr, this.rules, {}, {});\n    },\n    'Node, Array': function NodeArray(expr, rules) {\n      return this(expr, rules, {}, {});\n    },\n    'Node, Array, Object': function NodeArrayObject(expr, rules, scope) {\n      return this(expr, rules, scope, {});\n    },\n    'Node, Array, Object, Object': function NodeArrayObjectObject(expr, rules, scope, options) {\n      rules = _buildRules(rules);\n      var res = resolve(expr, scope);\n      res = removeParens(res);\n      var visited = {};\n      var str = res.toString({\n        parenthesis: 'all'\n      });\n\n      while (!visited[str]) {\n        visited[str] = true;\n        _lastsym = 0; // counter for placeholder symbols\n\n        for (var i = 0; i < rules.length; i++) {\n          if (typeof rules[i] === 'function') {\n            res = rules[i](res, options);\n          } else {\n            flatten(res);\n            res = applyRule(res, rules[i]);\n          }\n\n          unflattenl(res); // using left-heavy binary tree here since custom rule functions may expect it\n        }\n\n        str = res.toString({\n          parenthesis: 'all'\n        });\n      }\n\n      return res;\n    }\n  });\n  simplify.simplifyCore = simplifyCore;\n  simplify.resolve = resolve;\n\n  function removeParens(node) {\n    return node.transform(function (node, path, parent) {\n      return isParenthesisNode(node) ?

Function `callback`\n   *   is called with `value` as parameter and must return a string.\n   *\n   * When `value` is an Object:\n   *\n   * - When the object contains a property `format` being a function, this function\n   *   is invoked as `value.format(options)` and the result is returned.\n   * - When the object has its own `toString` method, this method is invoked\n   *   and the result is returned.\n   * - In other cases the function will loop over all object properties and\n   *   return JSON object notation like '{\"a\": 2, \"b\": 3}'.\n   *\n   * When value is a function:\n   *\n   * -
